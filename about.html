        Maybe you want to show people where you're at and where to look if you you don't show up at work on Monday. Maybe you want to share with your friends some of the best dive bars. Or maybe you want to show off all states you've visited.
      </p>
      <p>This app will save all the locations entered to it with a note attached to it. You share the map with everyone else. Or at leat that's the goal.</p>
